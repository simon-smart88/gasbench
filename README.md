## Gasbench

A Shiny for python app for benchmarking gas usage depending on floor area, occupancy and external temperatures using data from the [Smart Energy Research Lab](https://serl.ac.uk/). Connects to the [Octopus Energy API](https://developer.octopus.energy/rest/) to fetch gas usage and uses [meteostat](https://dev.meteostat.net/) to fetch weather data.
